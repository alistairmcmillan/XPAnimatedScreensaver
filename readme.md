XP ANIMATED SCREENSAVER
-----------------------
I got bored with the default screensaver that comes with Windows XP, that displays a static image of the Windows XP signage on different parts of the screen. So I created this  version that is animated.  Still boring, but at least a little improvement than the Microsoft version.

INSTALL
-------
Extract "XP Animated.scr" into your "Windows/System32"  directory.

UNINSTALL
---------
Delete "XP Animated.scr" from Windows/system32 directory.

SET AS DEFAULT
--------------
If you want the default account to use this screensaver then run the included "setAsDefault.reg" screensaver. This way this screensaver will replace the static Microsoft version that appears when no-one has logged into a Windows XP machine.
